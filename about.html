                        <h3>Our Foundation</h3>
                        <p>PL TREASURERS LIMITED was founded and registered in 2023 by Percy Maleta. The company was established after identifying a lack of attention to value addition and marketing of Malawi's gemstones, ornamental stones, and artcrafts. Percy, a veteran gemstone dealer who has been in the industry since 2006, observed that most gemstones are exported in their raw form, leading to a significant loss of profits, skills, and foreign exchange earnings for Malawi. Determined to address these challenges, Percy founded PL TREASURERS LIMITED to bring about change in the gemstone industry.</p>

Percy also serves as the Ambassador for Virtu Gem, a Chicago-based social enterprise, representing Malawi. Before this role, he worked as Virtu Gem's Exporter and Assistant Coordinator. Furthermore, Percy is the Coordinator for "She Is Lost Control," a British firm that supports women miners in Malawi by purchasing responsibly sourced gemstones and offering training programs.</p>

                    <h3>Ethical Sourcing and Traceability</h3>
                    <p>Our gemstones are traceable and ethically sourced and this is the core part of our business traceability and ethical sourcing. We are involved in the whole chain of production from the mine to the market. We know almost all the miners we deal with by name, we have worked with them over the years, and we also work with almost all mining cooperatives in Malawi.</p>
                    <p>Ethical sourcing does not have a universal definition among industry experts, however, we view ethical sourcing as sourcing gemstones that are mined in the context where the miners' well-being and the environment is taken into consideration. We understand that mining regulations and standards vary by country to country.</p>
                    <p>We don't buy and use gemstones under the following conditions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Child labor was used in mining the gemstone.</li>
                        <li>Miners are paid unfairly or taken advantage of.</li>
                        <li>Transactions that directly or indirectly fund conflict or terrorism.</li>
